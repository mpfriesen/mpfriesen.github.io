[{"id":1,"headline":"Election results","link":"https://gov.oregonlive.com/election/","category":"Maps, graphics","published":"2010-present","desc":"Real-time election results and maps for the 2020 Oregon general election. I created a backend system in 2010 using PHP and MySQL to allow a team to input election results from Oregon's 36 counties and pushing them live to our site within minutes, often outpacing the AP's results. The current system is still based on those (kind of creaky) bones but also allows us to call races (and automatically tweet those calls) on our own based on the current results and our own staff knowledge of the political landscape, again usually outpacing AP.","tools":"PHP, Python, MySQL, JQuery, D3","img_slug":"election"},

{"id":3,"headline":"Property tax winners and losers","link":"https://projects.oregonlive.com/taxes/property/map/","category":"Map","published":"September 2015","desc":"Oregon homeowners used to pay taxes based on what their property was worth. That connection ended in 1997 when voters limited how much property values could grow each year for tax purposes. Homeowners in slow-growth neighborhoods now routinely pay higher taxes than people with homes of greater value in gentrified areas. We wondered: What would happen if the tax benefits of 1997’s Measure 50 were redistributed based on market value? This interactive lets users look up any Portland metro-area address and see how property taxes would be affected on properties within a quarter-mile radius.","tools":"R, PostgreSQL, PostGIS, QGIS, Tilemill, Leaflet, Javascript, JQuery","img_slug":"tax"},
